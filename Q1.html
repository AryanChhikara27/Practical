    <p style="font-family:'Courier New';font-size:20px">An <strong>Aircraft</strong> is a vehicle or machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It <em>counters the force of gravity</em> by using either <strong>static lift</strong> or by using the <strong>dynamic lift of an airfoil</strong>, or in a few cases the <strong>downward thrust</strong> from jet engines. Common examples of aircraft include <em>airplanes, helicopters, airships (including blimps), gliders, paramotors, and hot air balloons</em>.</p>
    <p style="font-size:18px">The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called <strong>Aviation</strong>. The science of aviation, including <em>designing</em> and <em>building aircraft</em>, is called <strong>aeronautics</strong>. <br>Crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard <strong>Pilot</strong>, but <em>unmanned aerial</em> vehicles may be <em>remotely controlled</em> or <em>self-controlled</em> by <em>onboard computers</em>. <br>Aircraft may be classified by different criteria, such as <em>lift type</em>,<em> aircraft propulsion</em>, usage and others.</p>
